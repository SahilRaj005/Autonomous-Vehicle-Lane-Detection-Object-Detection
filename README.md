## Autonomous Vehicle Lane Detection & Object Detection
A computer vision-based system for lane detection and object recognition designed for autonomous vehicles. This project combines real-time lane line tracking and object detection using deep learning techniques to enhance driving safety and lane discipline.

## 📌 Overview
This project integrates two critical features for autonomous driving:

Lane Detection using image processing and edge detection techniques.

Object Detection using YOLOv5 to recognize road objects such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs.

Together, these modules aim to enable safe navigation by recognizing lanes and obstacles in real-time from dashcam or simulation footage.

## 🧠 Key Features
🔍 Lane detection using OpenCV, Canny Edge Detection, and Hough Transform

📦 Object detection using YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) for real-time performance

🎥 Real-time inference on video input streams

🧪 Visualization with lane overlays and object bounding boxes
